# MixSTE
Official implementation of CVPR 2022 paper([MixSTE: Seq2seq Mixed Spatio-Temporal Encoder for 3D Human Pose Estimation in Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00859)).

[Update]
Sorry delayed so long time.

Due to the code being located on the server I can not download code easily, and I have no GPU to retrain and test on that machine. The good news is now I have got temporary access to download the code. It is now rearranged and will also be submitted to the [MMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose), and at the same time, I will also release a version of the original code.

These will happen before October 15 2022.

Sorry again for the delay. üôè

~~The code is coming soon...(before May, 2022)~~
